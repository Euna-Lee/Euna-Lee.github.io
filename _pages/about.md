I'm a senior at Cornell University studying Computer Science, set to graduate a semester early to pursue a Masters of Engineering by Spring 2026. My journey blends technical creativity with a passion for teaching, whether through building games or breaking down complex ideas simply.

Some of my most rewarding experiences have come from turning ideas into playable projects. I went from stumbling through learning Unity for a simple platformer, which was my first dive into game development. Then, I cruised through building a text-based implementation of Clue in OCaml where it was interesting to see how functioning programming met classic board games. Most recently, I worked on a fun action-strategy game called Super Food Chain where I learned the difficulties of designs, mechanics, and collisions. These projects sharpened my technical skills and taught me how to communicate clearly, improve through feedback, and tackle creative challenges in teams.

I further honed these skills through my love for education. I designed custom lesson plans for 1-1 tutoring in Python, Algebra, and more. Additinally, I guided peers as a CS course consultant at Cornell and taught learners of all ages in educational summer programs. Recently, I completed a course in Educational Psychology which included theoretical study and fieldwork in a 5th-grade classroom. Whether debugging code or explaining recursion to a beginner, Iâ€™ve learned that great teaching, like great software, starts with empathy and clarity. These experiences have deepened my ability to communicate complex concepts in a clear and engaging way, which is a skill I value as much in teaching as I do in software development.
